    <p>
      In this article, we will explore the challenges and opportunities of applying machine learning to light.
    </p>

    <h4>Introduction and context</h4>
    <p>Goal is to measure many things continuously in biological substances.
  </p>

<p>  Different ways to measure stuff - electrochemical, physical, optical - however there are fundamental challenges around real-time continuous measurements of multiple biomarkers at physiological concentrations and timescales.
  </p>


    <h4>Challenges</h4>
<p>However, raman struggles with intrinsic variability due to patient to patient variability as well as other sources of variability such as those coming from the measurement device (usually needing to be overcome by complex and costly instrumentation) and environment.
  <d-footnote id="d-footnote-1"><i> Popp, Bocklitz et al (2016) 'Towards an improvement of model transferability for Raman
    spectroscopy in biological applications'</i>
  </d-footnote></p>

  <p>While many promising papers show that people can accurately measure many biomarkers with raman in the lab - industrial and clinical solutions struggle with variability meaning that analyzing raman is time- and resource and expert intensive and therefore not widely adopted outside of a few specific use-cases (such as bioreactor monitoring and illicit drug detection).</p>
  <h4>How one measures concentrations with Raman</h4>
  <p>Raman signal is a mix of raman scattering, fluorescence, noise, and cosmic rays (spikes).

      <figure>
        <img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FthunderDB%2Fb9HedgJmiX.png?alt=media&token=05beb9d6-8719-4e5b-ae08-1b2a3dbfb65c" />
    </figure>
      </div>

    Area under raman spectra generally relates linearly to concentrations of corresponding biomarkers which allows for concentration measurement.
  </p>

    </figure>

    <p>By measuring the area under the preprocessed and baseline subtracted raman signal we can get a regression against concentration of the biomarker of interest. We can then use this regression line with the spectra to map concentrations over</p>

    <p>However, direct measurement concentration via raman signals is non-trivial due to 
      <ol> 
        <li> Low signal to noise ratio. </li>
        <li>  Background variation.</li>
        <li> Raman peaks, shifting, distorting and overlapping. </li>
      </ol>

  <h4>Modeling Spectra</h4>
  <p>TODO-UPDATE TEXT: We can use a deep learning model to model the spectra and then use this model to predict concentrations. This is a powerful tool for predicting biomarker concentrations.
    <h4>Conclusions</h4>

    <p>
      <b> Key observations:</b>
      <ul>
         <li>We can treat everyting as a linearly separable system.</li>
         <li>Borrow metrics from DL synthetic image generation (SNR, SSIM, Wasserstein Distance) since they preserve fine-grained features much better than standard spectroscopy metrics (MSE).</li>
         <li>Focus on first solving and productionizing background subtraction via deployable API.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Other important observations (out of scope for this discussion):
        <ul>
           <li>Volume over data quality... up to a point.</li>
           <li>Establishing the right baseline and evaluation metrics in biology and medicine is non-trivial.</li>
           <li>Bridging culture between scientists, doctors and software engineering can make or break ML projects.</li>
        </ul>
